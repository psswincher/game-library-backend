# Game Libray Backend

This backend creates a mongodb that stores game data and user data. It pulls game data from an Airtable base, allowing adminstrators to manage their game data in a stable, pre-built environment. This dame data is never edited by frontend users.

It pulls data from Airtable upon startup, including download links for game images stored in Airtable. It then passes those images from the download links to an AWS Bucket while matching generated links from the bucket to the database.

Finally, it also stores user information, including emails, passwords and preferences for users to create their own profiles.

## Setup

Please create a .env file in the project root and include the AWS access and Airtable information sent to code review.
