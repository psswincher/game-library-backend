Theory of Operations:

1. We manage an Airtable base of board games. Airtable is very easy for us to use on site and saves us the pain of building an entire custom frontend geared towards employees.

2. This backend pulls game data from airtable, including image download urls. It passes the game data to mongodb and uploads the images to an AWS S3 server.
